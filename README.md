### Hey lol

- I'm actually a 3D artist, not a programmer.
- My main platform for my artworks is YouTube and Twitter!
- My pronouns are she/they
- That's all
- I don't know why I'm here
-
- Also I'm bad at grammar :(
- The (is) in option 2, is supposed to be (are)
- But I didn't realize that because I'm dumb
- 
- Alrighty, thanks for reading!
- Hope you're doing great <3
- I love you!
